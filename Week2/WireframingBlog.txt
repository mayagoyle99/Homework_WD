Five Important Considerations for Wireframing

This article really emphasized how important it is to wireframe before you jump in and start designing. 
Wireframing helps you clarify the proble, and really gain clarity about the isues so you know what you're doing. 
You can use research and ask questions for this. 
It also helps make sure your design has a good workflow and makes sure everyone is on the same page throughout the whole process. 
You don't want to spend hours on a really intracite design to just realize that you've got the wrong idea or the flow isn't right. 
You can use this step to also better understand your tools and audience. 
Make sure your wireframes are tailored to the target audience and that you're being accurate and correct.

I really liked this article because it was concise and to the point. 
It helped me better understand that you really shouldn't jump right in and get ahead of yourself. 
Although it might feel like an extra step, it's going to make your work better, clearer and shorter in the long run.
